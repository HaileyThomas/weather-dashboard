# Weather Dashboard üå§Ô∏è
## Description
- Building a weather dashboard has been a great way for me to test out my coding skills that we have learned so far and to implement server side API's in a fun way.
- To begin building the dashboard I started with fetching the location API provided by Open Weather. When a user enters in the city it was then able to get the latitude and longitude from the city name they entered. Using the latitude and longitude, I was then able to use then to fetch the weather API also provided by Open Weather. With this new data, I was ready to start building the new DOM elements to display to show the current weather as well as the five day future forecast.
- A problem that I ran into building this project was saving the city information without it duplicating. I was able to figure out how to get rid of any history duplicates on reload but when I refactor the code I hope to be able to figure out how to make sure there are no duplicates on the page without a reload, maybe in the updateHistory function.
- This is definitely my favorite project that we have done so far, I have had a lot of fun with it. I feel very comfortable with starting to work with server side API's and am so excited to see what I will create in the future because it has opened up a world of possibilities.
